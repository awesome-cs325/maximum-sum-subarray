## To Use
All code was tested on Arch Linux (Gnome 3.16) with Python 3.4.3,
`python-matplotlib` package, and `python-scipy` package.

Runnables:
 - `src/test.py` : Run the actual test against `MMS_Problems.txt`
 - `src/graphs.py` : Generate (for now) an inital graph of time vs. complexity for Algorithm 1

Many of the files have a suitable `main()` function for easy testing.
